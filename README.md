PGP Words for Scala
===================

by @colindean

Introduction
------------

This library enables conversion from a byte stream to a phonetically
distinguishable list of words suitable for effectively saying the bytes in a way
that is extremely unlikely to cause mixups.

It is an implementation of the [PGP Word List
specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP_word_list).
